                                                        Quora System Design

1. Features of Quora: 

--> Follow
        Users
        Questions
        Topics

--> Topics 
--> News feed
        Relevance based on connections users/topics
        Time Decay
        Popular  
--> Search 
--> Create a question
--> Answer a question
--> Comments/replica
--> Upvotes + Downvotes
--> Multimedia


2. Estimating the scale:

# users --> 200 M users
    * Daily active users(DAU) --> let's say 10% of users use so it becomes 20M users
    * Monthly active users(MAU) --> let's say 5 - 12 % it becomes 
    * 10M questions / Daily
    * Answers / day ---> In which we have 8M questions which is not active and 2M question will be active

3. Storage Requirements:
    * Question --> text(100MB)
    * Tags(links), (image(s)), video(s)
    100 * 200B --> 200MB --> 2GB
    answer / day --> 50M * 500B --> 2500MB --> 25GB
    40GB / day is being created so
    40 GB * 365 * 10 ---> 145 TB for 10 years
    Let's say one machine supports 5TB of data then :
    145 / 5 --> 30 machines / 0.6 ---> 50 machines  

    Master Database will have some slave database so that master db slow downs then we can use slaves to get the data out of it and slaves will have data copied from master database.


4. Questions per second(QPS)
    writes 60M / 24 * 60 * 60   per second ----> 700 queries per seconds for write operation. Let' say 1400 writes per second 

    2.5B / 24 * 60 * 60 = B / 60 * 60 = 40R OPS
