Question -> It's the end of 2016, and the owner of Masai Bakery wants to write an SQL query that finds the COUNT of orders placed in 2016 by customer e-mail address. She wants to ORDER the results by the COUNT of orders placed in 2016, descending, so that she can personally send thank-you e-mails to Masai Bakerys top customers by order volume. Can you write a query that will help the owner of Masai Bakery find the COUNT of all orders placed in 2016, by customer e-mail address, sorted Descending ?
